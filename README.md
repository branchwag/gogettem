# GO Gettem!

A template for getting started with a simple webpage using Go + echo </br>
</br>

## btw I ran these commands to get started:

```
      go mod init gogettem
      go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4
      go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest
      go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
      go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware
      air
```

## Or, just bash it

Alternatively, you can just run the 'goproject.sh' bash script included in this repo to get a project started. Then, after VSCode opens, edit your files as you wish and run the 'air' command to start your server. Or do whatever you want, I'm not your mom.
